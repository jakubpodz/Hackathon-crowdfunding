# Crowdfunding DApp

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding application built using **React** and **Hardhat**. The app leverages **Solidity** smart contracts to manage crowdfunding campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain. The front end is built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. MetaMask and Web3Modal are used for Ethereum wallet connections, while Ethers.js facilitates blockchain interactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`components`**: Contains reusable React components like `Card`, `Footer`, `Hero`, `Logo`, `NavBar`, `PopUp`, and `Menu`.
- **`contracts`**: Contains Solidity contracts (`CrowdFunding.sol`) and the corresponding ABI files (`CrowdFunding.json`).
- **`pages`**: Next.js pages, including `_app.js` for global settings and `index.js` as the main entry point.
- **`scripts`**: Deployment scripts and Hardhat configuration files.
- **`styles`**: Global CSS styles, including Tailwind CSS configurations.
- **`config`**: Constants and configuration files used throughout the project.

## Key Libraries

This project uses several essential libraries:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment to compile, deploy, and test Solidity smart contracts.
- **Web3Modal**: A library to connect various wallets, like MetaMask, to the application.
- **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crowdfunding-dapp.git
   cd crowdfunding-dapp
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables (e.g., Infura API keys) in a `.env` file if required.

4. Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy the contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network your_network
   ```

6. Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Connect your wallet (MetaMask or other supported wallets) through Web3Modal.
2. Create and manage crowdfunding campaigns.
3. Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the Ethers.js library.

## Importing Required Libraries

Here’s a sample import snippet that demonstrates how we use React, Web3Modal, and Ethers in this project:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import Web3Modal from "web3modal";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering
- **Hardhat**: Smart contract development and testing
- **Web3Modal**: Wallet connection library
- **Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework
